      <h1>Add an OpenDSA Exercise or Visualization to a Moodle Course</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      OpenDSA is an eTextbook project developed at Virginia Tech. OpenDSA
      materials include many visualizations and interactive exercises that
      support courses in a wide variety of Computer Science-related topics such
      as Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Formal and Programming Languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenDSA has hundreds of visualizations and exercises.
      Most algorithms and data structures are illustrated by interactive
      algorithm visualizations. Students could enter their own test cases to see
      how the algorithm or data structure works on that input, and they can
      control the pacing of the visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
      A course instructor who is using the Moodle LMS can add individual
      OpenDSA materials directly into their Moodle courses. Below are detailed
      instructions on how to do this. Gradable exercises will report scores to
      your Moodle's gradebook.
    </p>

    <p>
      To add one or more OpenDSA modules, exercises, or visualizations in your Moodle course, perform the
      following steps:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to
      <a href="http://opendsa.org" target="_blank"> OpenDSA.org </a>
      and create an account.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Send an email to
      <a href="mailto:opendsa@cs.vt.edu"> opendsa@cs.vt.edu </a>
      and ask for instructor access. If this is your first time using OpenDSA,
      please include your Moodle URL in the email.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you are provided with the instructor
      access, you need to click on your email address at the top right corner
      of the page and you will be redirected to a page from where you can copy
      your consumer key and a shared secret as shown in the image below:
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/keysecret.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong>
      Next, navigate to your course in Moodle and click on <em>"Add an
      activity or resource"</em>.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle1.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong>
      Select <em>"External Tool"</em> from the list and click <em>"Add"</em>.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle2.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong>
      Click on the <em>"+"</em> icon on the right of <em>Preconfigured
        tool</em> to add a new Tool Provider.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle3.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter a tool name (e.g. OpenDSA)</li>
          <li>Enter
            <a href="https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/lti/resource">
            https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/lti/resource</a> for
            <em>"Tool URL"</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Paste your consumer key and the shared secret that you copied in
            <em>Step 3</em>
          </li>
        </ul> 
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle4.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 8:</strong> Under <em>"Privacy"</em> settings, select
      <em>"Always"</em> for all three dropdowns.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle5.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 9:</strong> Click on <em>"Show more..."</em> and check
      <em>"Content-Item Message"</em>. This enables instructors to select
      content (i.e. exercises) to be added to their courses.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle6.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 10:</strong> Once the above steps are completed, click "Save
      Changes" to add OpenDSA as a Tool Provider.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 11:</strong> Now you should be back on a previous page.
      Select <em>OpenDSA</em> from <em>Preconfigured tool</em> dropdown and
      click on <em>"Select content"</em>. This will cause Moodle to send an LTI 
      launch request to the Tool URL you set in <em>Step 7</em>. If the Select 
      content button is disabled, or otherwise doesn't work, refresh the page.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle7.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 12:</strong>
      If this is your first time going through this process for your course,
      you will be asked to provide some information that OpenDSA can use to
      identify your course offering. Fill out the required fields and click
      "Submit".
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle8.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 13:</strong>
      Once you do that, a tree view will be displayed listing the topics for
      modules, visualizations, and exercises that are available. To expand one of the
      categories click the arrow to the left of the folder icon. 
      You will then see a collection of OpenDSA modules.
      If you want to add a module to your course, just click on the name of the module.
      Expanding a module by clicking the arrow to the left of its name will display the names of the exercises and
      visualizations contained within that module. 
      If you want to add an individual exercise or visualization to your course, simply click on it.
      
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle9.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 14:</strong>
      The <em>Activity name</em> and the <em>Tool URL</em> text fields will be
      automatically filled with the name and the URL that will be used to
      launch the resource.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle10.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 15:</strong>
      Select if you want this OpenDSA resources as
      <strong>graded</strong> or <strong>ungraded</strong> content by going to
      the <em>"Grade"</em> section. Select the <em>type</em> of the
      exercise from the <em>"Type"</em> dropdown. Finally, click <em>"Save and return to course"</em> or <em>"Save and display"</em> at the bottom of the page.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle11.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 16:</strong>
      The selected exercise should be now added to your course.
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle12.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 17:</strong>
      The students will be able to view the OpenDSA exercise or visualization
      by clicking on it from the list of topics as shown above. One example
      of OpenDSA exercise is shown here:
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle13.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
      <br>
      If you added a graded content, in that case, once a student completes an
      assignment, his/her grade will be submitted to Moodle's gradebook as
      shown below:<br><br>
      <div class="text-center">
        <%= image_tag "guides/Moodle14.png", style:'width:50%' %>
      </div>
    </p>
  </span>
</div>
