    %h2 What Is OpenDSA?
    %p
      OpenDSA is infrastructure and materials to support courses in a
      wide variety of Computer Science-related topics such as Data
      Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Formal Languages, Finite Automata,
      and Programming Languages.
    %p
      OpenDSA materials include many visualizations and interactive
      exercises. Our philosophy is that students learn
      best when they engage the material and then practice it
      until they have demonstrated their proficiency.
      OpenDSA provides a place for students
      to practice skills and develop knowledge with a
      variety of exercises including small code writing problems,
      proficiency exercises where students demonstrate knowledge of an
      algorithm by interacting with a data structure, and questions
      about knowledge.

    %h2 Do I Have to Be Enrolled?
    %p
      No, you do not have to be a student enrolled in a course to use OpenDSA.
      OpenDSA provides comprehensive support for teachers who want
      to use our materials for their textbook or homeworks.
      But we also support independent learners who are just practicing
      on their own. See our
      =link_to "sample books", home_books_path
      list , where you can practice any exercises or view
      any materials that you wish.

    %h2 Use in a Course
    %p
      For teachers, OpenDSA allows you to create your own custom
      eTextbooks, selecting from our comprehensive body of materials
      and exercises. Use OpenDSA as supplementary reading material, or
      use it as your primary textbook and homeworks.
