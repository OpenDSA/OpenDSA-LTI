OpenDSA: Getting Started
========================

*  OpenDSA documentation URL:
   `http://opendsa.readthedocs.org/ <http://opendsa.readthedocs.org/>`_
*  This includes a "getting started" guide
*  To do anything, you need to install the toolchain

   * Git
   * make
   * Python
   * Sphinx

*  Viewing a web page: Use
   `OpenDSA/WebServer
   <https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/blob/master/WebServer>`_

   * From a command prompt, when in the OpenDSA top-level directory,
     just type ``WebServer`` to start it.

*  Ideally you would install the toolchain and compile an (existing)
   book instance.

   * From the OpenDSA top level, type: ``make C2GEN``
