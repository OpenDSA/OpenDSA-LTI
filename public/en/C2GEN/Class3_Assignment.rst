To Do On Your Own
=================

*  Wrap up any remaining installation issues that you might have
*  Pick an existing RST file, and work on editing it to make
   changes that will make it a better fit for your class
*  Create some simple questions using the Khan Academy Framework, and
   add them to your edited RST file.
*  Compile and view your results. Remember: You have to view it
   through a web server, not just looking at the files locally on your
   browser. So look at and run the "WebServer" script in the OpenDSA
   repository.
