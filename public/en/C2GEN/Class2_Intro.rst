Introduction
============

Our second presentation is aimed at instructors who want to use
OpenDSA for their class.
The presentation can be found at
`http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/co1uY4f31u <http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/co1uY4f31u>`_

Once you have played through the presentation (or at least reviewed
the material on the following page), we encourage you to work through
the assignment that follows.

Today we are going to talk about the following:

* Instructor's tools
* Configuring a book instance (from existing materials)
* Some examples of where OpenDSA has been used in classes
* Log analysis and examples of things that we have learned from our
  log analysis
