To Do On Your Own
=================

*  Go through at least one of the following OpenDSA modules:

   *  :ref:`Binary Search <binary search> <BinarySearch>`
   *  :ref:`Insertion Sort <insertion sort> <InsertionSort>`
   *  :ref:`BST <BST> <BST>`

*  Install the toolchain and compile your own copy of the C2GEN "book".

   *  OpenDSA documentation URL:
      `http://opendsa.readthedocs.org/ <http://opendsa.readthedocs.org/>`_
   *  See the "getting started" guide in Section 2.
   *  To do anything, you need to install the toolchain

      * Git
      * make
      * Python
      * Sphinx

   *  Viewing a web page: Use
      `OpenDSA/WebServer
      <https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/blob/master/WebServer>`_

      * From a command prompt, when in the OpenDSA top-level directory,
        just type ``WebServer`` to start it.

   *  Ideally you would install the toolchain and compile an (existing)
      book instance.

      * From the OpenDSA top level, type: ``make C2GEN``
