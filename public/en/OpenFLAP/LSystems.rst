L-Systems: Model the Growth of Plants
=====================================

L-systems use a different type of grammar to model the growth of
plants, organisms, and fractals.
You define a grammar and it generates a sequence of strings that get
longer and longer.
Some of the symbols represent graphics such as the drawing of a line,
the changing of direction, etc.

   DEMO the growth of an L-System tree with JFLAP.

We will study L-systems later in the semester as another application
of grammars.
