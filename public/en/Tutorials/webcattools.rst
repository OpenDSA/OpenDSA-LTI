Installing the Web-CAT Submission Plug-in for Eclipse
=====================================================

Introduction
------------

Here are instructions for how to install the Web-CAT submission
plug-in for Eclipse.
These instructions assume that you are running Eclipse versions
Oxygen or Photon.

**Note:** This might be a good time to also update Eclipse. 
If you are running a version earlier than Oxygen, then you should
install the latest version directly.
If you are running Oxygen or Photon already, then you can check for
updates at ``Help --> Check for Updates``.

Installing the Plug-in
----------------------

Un-Installing an Old Plug-in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have an earlier version of the Web-CAT plug-in
installed, you will first need to uninstall it.
For those installing it for the first time, skip to the section on
Installing the Plug-In. 
 
Open Eclipse, and in the tool bar at the top of the screen, go to
``Help --> About Eclipse``. Then click on the button that says
``Installation Details``.
After clicking on ``Installation Details``,
a window something like this should come up: 

.. odsafig:: Images/InstallDetails.png
   :width: 650
   :align: center
   :capalign: justify
   :figwidth: 90%
   :alt: InstallDetails

Select ``Web-CAT Electronic Submitter`` and click ``Uninstall``.
Follow the prompts, clicking ``Next`` and ``Finish`` as appropriate,
and restart Eclipse to complete the process.
 

Installing the Plug-in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open Eclipse, and in the tool bar at the top of the screen, go to
``Help --> Install New Software``.
The following window will come up:

.. odsafig:: Images/PluginInstall1.png
   :width: 750
   :align: center
   :capalign: justify
   :figwidth: 90%
   :alt: PluginInstall1

In the ``Work With`` text box, paste this link:
http://web-cat.org/eclstats
 
* Next, click ``Add``.
  A dialog box will pop up with two text boxes.

* Make sure the above URL is in the box labeled ``Location``,
  and put in a sensible name (like "Web-CAT plugin") in the box labeled
  ``Name``.

* Once that's done, click ``Add``.
 
This is what the window should look like now:

.. odsafig:: Images/PluginInstall2.png
   :width: 750
   :align: center
   :capalign: justify
   :figwidth: 90%
   :alt: PluginInstall2

* Check the two  boxes next to ``Web-CAT Electronic Assignments
  Feature`` and ``Web-CAT Java Development Extras``, and click ``Next``. 

* It will then tell you about files that it plans to install. Click ``Next`` again.

* Click ``Next`` again.

* Accept the terms of the license agreement, and click 'Finish'.
 
The install will start now.
It will only take a few seconds, but it will pause for a moment and
warn you that you are about to install software with unsigned
content.
Click ``OK`` to continue the installation, and restart Eclipse
when prompted to complete the process. 
 
Once you have the plug-in installed, you need to set it up to be able
to communicate with Web-CAT:

* Go to ``Window --> Preferences`` (``Eclipse --> Preferences`` on Mac).

* In the window that comes up, in the column on the left, click on
  Web-CAT Assignments.
  You should see this window:

.. odsafig:: Images/WebCATAssignment.png
   :width: 750
   :align: center
   :capalign: justify
   :figwidth: 90%
   :alt: WebCATAssignment

Put in the following information:

* Submission Definition URL: https://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/Web-CAT/WebObjects/Web-CAT.woa/wa/assignments/eclipse?institution=VT

* Email: Your VT email address (PID@vt.edu).

* Username: Your PID.

* You can leave Outgoing SMTP Mail Server blank.

* In the ``Download URL`` field, enter:
  http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/Web-CAT/assignments.xml

* Click on ``Apply and Close`` to complete the process.


Installing student.jar
----------------------

If you are using Web-CAT, then you probably will want to use the VT
local support for JUnit tests.
See |external_link1| for how to download the ``student.jar`` file and
some practical advice for getting started with JUnit testing.
At the time of this writing, the prefered version of JUnit to use is
Junit 4.

Installing formatting support
-----------------------------

You might want to make sure that your Eclipse style checker is as
close as possible to the style guide that Web-CAT is enforcing.
Download this file: |stylefile| (Right click and Save-As).
Then install it into Eclipse, as described below.

.. |stylefile| raw:: html

   <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~shaffer/vtcsstylefixed.xml" target =
   "_blank">vtcsstylefixed.xml</a>

Once it is installed, press CTRL-SHIFT-F (Windows) or COMMAND-SHIFT-F (Mac) within Eclipse to format your code. 


To install:

Mac:

``Eclipse->Preferences->Java->Code Style->Formatter->import``
the above file, then click ``okay``.

Windows:

``Window->Preferences->Java->Code Style->Formatter->import`` the above file,
then click ``okay``.
