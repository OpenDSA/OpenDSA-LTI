Merkle Trees
============

Merkle Trees
------------

A Merkle Tree (or Hash Tree) is a tree where all leaf nodes contain the cryptographic hash of a single 
data block. All internal nodes combine the hashes of their left and right child nodes and store a hash 
of both values. This means that the root node of the tree contains a hash that is the result of all leaves 
that were continually paired and hashed. Merkle Trees are essential in providing data integrity in the blockchain.

How Is It Used?
---------------

Merkle Trees act as the message hash of a single block. So far in this module, the requirement of a message has been 
to represent it as a hash so that we may derive a hash pointer. The Merkle Tree satisifies this with the root 
hash value. The root is representative of all data leaves of the tree and can act as the message hash.

Why Is It Useful?
-----------------

Merkle Trees are useful in providing for less overhead per piece of data. To need a block for a single piece of data 
would mean a quickly growing chain where the verification work largely exceeds the information kept. Merkle Trees allow 
for an incredible amount of different data to be stored into a singular hash. These are called the transactions of a block. 

They also provide a way to not only create another level of cryptographic security. With each tree level, there exists more 
hashes that act as a level of security. In addition to finding a nonce that agrees with the previous hash pointer
and the message, the message itself contains a hurdle: an entire half of the tree must be made to agree with the Merkle root when one 
transaction is changed. In the same way that a malicious actor would change the message of a block and reproduce 
a new hash pointer, the same actor would change a transaction. However, this change must agree with verification of the tree.

This fact leads us to the fact that Merkle Trees also allow these transactions to be efficiently verifiable. 
To this end, it's important to note that the branches of a Merkle Tree are inherently modular. 
The verification of a single transaction does not require the verification of every other transaction as shown below.
