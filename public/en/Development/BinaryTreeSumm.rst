Binary Tree Chapter Summary [Stub]
==================================

This module contains "end of chapter" questions to review things
related to the whole chapter. Need to figure out what the proper set
of prereqs is.

.. TODO::
   :type: Exercise

   Show a tree. Ask if it is a BST, a heap, or neither.

.. TODO::
   :type: Exercise

   Show a tree. Ask if it is a Full Binary Tree, Complete Binary Tree,
   or neither.

.. todo::
   :type: Exercise

   Given: A tree generated at random (constrained so that the
   probabilities work out reasonably).

   Question: Does this tree meet the BST property? Does it meet the
   min-heap property? Neither? Both? (show these as four choices.)

.. todo::
   :type: Exercise

   More questions (short/MC):

   Is a heap a binary tree? (Yes, logically)

   Are heaps implemented using trees? (not usually)

   Is a binary tree a search tree? (No. Binary tree is just a
   structural property)

.. todo::
   :type: Proficiency Exercise

   Insert a value into a heap. This is a bit
   different from the current binaryheap-insert-proficiency.html in
   that it should be possible to insert it in a way that violates the
   shape property. In the current version, the shape is given. The
   current one also shows the array along with the tree. Need to pick
   some of these issues apart?
