.. slide:: Analysis

   * Best-case behavior is "balanced": :math:`\Theta(\log n)` (like a
     BST).
   * Worst-case behavior: All nodes at the same level (regardless of
     what level): Effectively degenerates to a linked list (like a
     BST).
   * Reality: Its behavior is not so dependent on order of inserts as
     a BST. Its similar to what BST cost would be if we randomized the
     input order. A huge improvement in expected performance!

.. slide:: Programming Principles

   #. All container classes should be general.
   #. Any container class's initial state should be identical to its
      empty state.
