Indexing
--------

.. slide:: Indexing

   * Goals:
      * Store large files
      * Support multiple search keys
      * Support efficient insert, delete, and range queries


.. slide:: Files and Indexing

   * **Entry sequenced file**: Order records by time of insertion.
      * Search with sequential search

   * **Index file**: Organized, stores pointers to actual records.
      * Could be organized with a tree or other data structure.


.. slide:: Keys and Indexing

   * **Primary Key** : A unique identifier for records.  May be
     inconvenient for search.

   * **Secondary Key**: An alternate search key, often not unique for
     each record.  Often used for search key.


.. slide:: Linear Indexing (1)

   * **Linear index**: Index file organized as a simple sequence of
     key/record pointer pairs with key values are in sorted order.

   * Linear indexing is good for searching variable-length records.

.. slide:: Linear Indexing (2)

   * If the index is too large to fit in main memory, a second-level index
     might be used.

.. slide:: Tree Indexing (1)

   * Linear index is poor for insertion/deletion.

   * Tree index can efficiently support all desired operations:
      * Insert/delete
      * Multiple search keys (multiple indices)
      * Key range search


.. slide:: Tree Indexing (2)

      :output: show


.. slide:: Tree Indexing (3)

   * Difficulties when storing tree index on disk:
      * Tree must be balanced.
      * Each path from root to leaf should cover few disk pages.
