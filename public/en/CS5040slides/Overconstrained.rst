Over-Constrained Code

Over-Constrained Code
---------------------

.. slide:: Over-constrained Code (1)

   * Consider the situation where we have two points. We want to know which
     quadrant the second point (b) is in w.r.t. the first point (a)::

       if ((b.x < a.x) && (b.y < a.y))
         doNW();
       else if ((b.x < a.x) && (b.y >= a.y))
         doSW();
       else if ((b.x >= a.x) && (b.y < a.y))
         doNE();
       else if ((b.x >= a.x) && (b.y >= a.y))
         doSE();

   * This has the virtue of being quite logical and clear. However, it has
     some problems.


.. slide:: Over-constrained Code (2)

   * It is horribly inefficient, compared to alternatives.
   * But our real concern has to do with testing and code coverage.
   * Fact: No series of tests will cover all branches in this code.
   * Q: Why?
   * A: Consider every possible branch and see what can get
     triggered. Consider that there have to be at least 8+ branches, and
     only 4 possible inputs!!
   * Try to hit every branch by brute force, one at a time...


.. slide:: Over-constrained Code (3)

   * Q: If we want complete code coverage when there are only four
     logically distinct inputs, then we had better do what?
   * A: Come up with code that has only four branches!


.. slide:: Over-constrained Code (4)

   * Refactored code::

       if (b.x < a.x)
         if (b.y < a.y)
           doNW();
         else
           doSW();
       else
         if (b.y < a.y)
           doNE();
         else
           doSE();

   * Not only can you test every branch, but this is a lot more efficient!
     Every branch requires 2 tests!
