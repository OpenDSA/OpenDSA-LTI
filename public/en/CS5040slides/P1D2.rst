Project 1 Day 2
---------------

.. slide:: What you need to know about Hashing

   * Read Module 13.1, Skim 13.3, Read 13.6 carefully, Read 13.7.3
     Quadratic Probing, Read 13.9 Deletion

   * Feel free to use code posted as part of OpenDSA modules (Insert, search)

   * You can write Hash Table Class **assuming** that it uses the
     given hash function, and that the key is a string.

.. slide:: Primary design issue: Communications

   * World/DB class, Hash Table, Memory Manager need appropriate
     coordination.
   
   * World probably initializes memory manager, but probably does not
     interact with it to insert/process records. Mostly it interacts
     with hash table.
   
   * Hash table needs to interact with Memory Manager as it needs to
     get or store information.
   
   * You might have a record class that does more or less processing,
     and might or might not interact with the memory manager
           
.. slide:: What is stored in the hash table?                      

   * Clearly there has to be a key, and there has to be a value
     (a record?)
   
   * The key is a string; it is the name field for the record
  
   * The "value" might be dealt with in different ways.
      * Definitely NOT the record string (this is in memory manager)
      * Maybe the handle for the record? That means that the hash
        table needs to know about handles.

   * Can hide handles behind a Record class.
      * What is key? Store string? Get from Record? Space vs. Time
        tradeoff, either is reasonable

.. slide:: Milestone 2

   * Must pass some number of tests, some code coverage (from your
     JUnit tests), some style points

   * Functionally: Get the hash table working, get string update
     working.
