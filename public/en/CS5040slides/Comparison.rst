Comparison
----------

.. slide:: Comparison (1)

   * How do we generalize the concept of comparison?
   * "<" is not good enough. String < String won't give you what you
     want.
   * Need a general way to get the key out of a record
   * Define a method record.key()?
      * [Note for C++ users: Operator overloading is effectively the
        same thing.]
      * That is not good enough. What if we want to search on different
        key fields?

.. slide:: Comparison (2)

   * Fundamental issue: The key is a property of the context,
     NOT a property of the record.


.. slide:: KVpair

   This is a truly general way to solve the problem.

   What is being compared?

   What if we want to find the record that has a given key?
