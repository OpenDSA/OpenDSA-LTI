Binary Trees Part 3

Binary Trees Part 3
-------------------

.. slide:: Comparison (1)

   * How do we generalize the concept of comparison?
   * "<" is not good enough. String < String won't give you what you
     want.
   * Need a general way to get the key out of a record
   * Define a method record.key()?
      * [Note for C++ users: Operator overloading is effectively the
        same thing.]
      * That is not good enough. What if we want to search on different
        key fields?

.. slide:: Comparison (2)

   * Fundamental issue: The key is a property of the context,
     NOT a property of the record.


.. slide:: KVpair

   This is a truly general way to solve the problem.

   What is being compared?

   What if we want to find the record that has a given key?


.. slide:: Binary Tree Implementation (1)

   "Simple" node model.

.. slide:: Binary Tree Implementation (2)

   Internal nodes can be different from leaf nodes.

.. slide:: Design Patterns

   * Design patterns capture reusable pieces of design wisdom.

   * Goals:
      * Quickly communicate design wisdom to new designers
      * Give a shared vocabulary to designers

.. slide:: Space Overhead (1)

   * From the Full Binary Tree Theorem:
      * Half of the pointers are null.

   * If leaves store only data, then overhead depends on whether this
     is full tree.

   * Ex: Full tree, all nodes the same, with two pointers to children and
     one to element

      * Total space required is :math:`(3p + d)n`
      * Overhead: :math:`3pn`
      * If :math:`p = d`, this means :math:`3p/(3p + d) = 3/4` overhead.


.. slide:: Space Overhead (2)

   Eliminate pointers from the leaf nodes

   .. math::

      \frac{n/2(2p)}{n/2(2p) + dn} = \frac{p}{p + d}

   This is 1/2 if :math:`p = d`.

   :math:`(2p)/(2p + d)` if data only at leaves :math:`\Rightarrow`
   2/3 overhead.

   Note that some method is needed to distinguish leaves from internal
   nodes.
