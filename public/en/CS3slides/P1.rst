.. slide:: Generalizing Container Classes

   | Normally for container classes we would want to detach the
     implementation from the data type. But since the hash function is
     tied to the key type, we will hard-code the hash tables to the
     extent that the key type is a String. (But the data type should
     still be flexible.)

   | The Memory Manager has a byte array (it doesn't know strings)


.. slide:: Breaking Down the Project (1)

   | A bad design: Main file (Recordstore.java) initializes program and
     implements the command processor. Calls hash table to do main
     operations (which calls memory manager as necessary).


.. slide:: Breaking Down the Project (2)

   | A better design:
   |   Separate logical activities into separate classes (even if a
       couple of them end up small this time).
   |   Main class only initializes the program
   |   Command syntax is done in separate command processor class
   |   Command semantics are handled in a separate "world" or "database"
       class. For P1, this has hash table and memory manager objects.
