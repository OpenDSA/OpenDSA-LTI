Binary Trees Part 1
-------------------

.. slide:: Binary Trees

   A binary tree is made up of a finite set of nodes that is either
   empty or consists of a node called the root together with two
   binary trees, called the left and right subtrees, which are
   disjoint from each other and from the root.

   Notation: Node, children, edge, parent, ancestor, descendant, path,
   depth, height, level, leaf node, internal node, subtree.

.. slide:: Question

   * Write a recursive function named **count** that, given the root to a
     binary tree, returns a count of the number of nodes in the
     tree. Function **count** should have the following prototype::

        int count(BinNode root)


.. slide:: Traversals

   * Any process for visiting the nodes in some order is called a
     **traversal**.

   * Any traversal that lists every node in the tree exactly once is called
     an **enumeration** of the tree's nodes.

   * Preorder traversal: Visit each node before visiting its children.

   * Postorder traversal: Visit each node after visiting its children.

   * Inorder traversal: Visit the left subtree, then the node, then the
     right subtree.

   | Problems:
   |    This has a major bug
   |    It puts the focus in the wrong place: Should focus on the
        current node, not the children. This version is therefore more
        complicated.
