A Hard Information Flow Problem
===============================

Sometimes, passing the right information up and down the tree to
control a recursive function gets complicated.
The information flow itself is simple enough, but deciding what to
pass might be tricky.

A more difficult example is illustrated by the following problem.
Given an arbitrary binary tree we wish to determine if,
for every node :math:`A`, are all nodes in :math:`A`'s left
subtree less than the value of :math:`A`, and are all nodes in
:math:`A`'s right subtree greater than the value of :math:`A`?
(This happens to be the definition for a binary search tree.)
Unfortunately, to make this decision we need to know some context
that is not available just by looking at the node's parent or
children.

   To be a binary search tree, the left child of the node with value
   40 must have a value between 20 and 40.

As shown by Figure :num:`Figure #BSTCheckFig`,
it is not enough to verify that :math:`A`'s left child has a value
less than that of :math:`A`, and that :math:`A`'s right child
has a greater value.
Nor is it enough to verify that :math:`A` has a value consistent
with that of its parent.
In fact, we need to know information about what range of values is
legal for a given node.
That information might come from any of the node's ancestors.
Thus, relevant range information must be passed down the tree.
We can implement this function as follows.
